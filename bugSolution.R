```r
# Corrected code ensuring consistent column lengths.

# Option 1:  Creating a data frame with vectors of the same length
df <- data.frame(a = 1:3, b = 1:3)

# Option 2: Using rbind or cbind to handle different lengths (requires careful consideration of data structure)
#Note that if the column lengths are significantly different it is highly advisable to check the data source carefully
a <- 1:3
b <- 1:4
c <- c(a, NA) # adding NA to align with b length
df <- data.frame(a,b,c)

# Option 3: Check the data before trying to create the data frame
a <- 1:3
b <- 1:4
if(length(a) == length(b)){
df <- data.frame(a,b)
}else{
print("Error: Vectors must have the same length to create a data frame.")
}
